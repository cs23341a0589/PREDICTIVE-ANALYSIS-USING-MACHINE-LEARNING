In this task, predictive analysis is performed using machine learning techniques. The dataset is collected and preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. A suitable machine learning algorithm (such as Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest) is trained to predict the target variable. The model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score. The final output includes prediction results, evaluation metrics, and key insights derived from the model.
